It prompts for user information, generates a unique username, creates the user in the correct organizational unit, assigns group memberships based on department, and includes validation and loop logic to handle multiple entries. It was built as an extension to my Active Directory lab environment.

**Skills Used:**  
PowerShell scripting, Active Directory user and group management, logic control (loops, conditionals), secure password handling, organizational unit structure, automation in IT environments

It showcases best practices in infrastructure setup, user and group management, access control, and centralized policy enforcement using Group Policy Objects (GPOs). The lab includes a domain controller, Windows 10 clients, a dedicated print server, shared departmental folders with restricted access, mapped network drives, and GPO configurations for desktop environment settings. It reflects the type of structured, scalable IT environment used in real organizations.        

**Skills Used:**     
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Domain controller and client setup
- OU (Organizational Unit) hierarchy design
- User and security group management
- Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for configuration and access control
